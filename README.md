- **Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think** (Yanda Chen, Joe Benton, Ansh Radhakrishnan, Jonathan Uesato, Carson Denison, John Schulman, Arushi Somani, Peter Hase, Misha Wagner, Fabien Roger, Vlad Mikulik, Samuel R. Bowman, Jan Leike, Jared Kaplan, Ethan Perez; 2025). [arXiv:2505.05410](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05410) — Benchmarks CoT faithfulness across reasoning hints, showing that monitoring rarely exceeds a 20% reveal rate, RL can increase hint use without transparency, and CoT checks alone cannot guarantee absence of hidden behaviors.
